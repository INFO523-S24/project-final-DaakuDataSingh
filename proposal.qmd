## Introduction

The ODI dataset was chosen because it contains data from the last 20 years on historical cricket matches. From this data, we can use a regression model to predict which teams won in the 2023 season. The entire season will be predicted and the the actual 2023 data will be used to cross validate the results and determine the accuracy of the model. \## Why the ODI dataset

```{python}
#| label: load-pkgs
#| message: false
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
#import git_lfs
from git import Repo
```

## High-level Goal

In this project we will create a dashboard of a live, ongoing cricket match that updates and predict its plots and statistics at regular intervals.

## Goal Details

### Motivation:

For this project we wanted to showcase our prediction skill-set with the challenge of a live dataset, and what better live dataset to use than sports, so we went with our favorite sport - cricket. Our idea is to compare and contrast a predicted trend with the actual live trend. For the purposes of demonstration we won't use an actual real-time data as we found that there would be unwanted associated costs, so we will instead use a ready made latest dataset, where our back-end server will automatically update the data table and communicate it to the front-end at regular intervals, essentially mocking a live match.

### Description of datasets:

We'll use two datasets:

1.  **ODI_Match_Data.csv**: Provides facts about the location and season of the cricket matches along with team information and the play results from each team member. We'll need this one to investigate partnerships between batsmen. It's dimensions are 155432 rows of data by 23 variable columns

    Variables that we'll use:

    | Variable Name | Data type | Description                                                                                    |
    |:------------------|:------------------|:---------------------------------|
    | match_id      | double    | A unique identifier for each ODI cricket match.                                                |

    | striker       | character | The batsman who is currently facing the ball.                                                  |
    | non_striker   | character | The batsman at the non-striker's end.                                                          |
    | bowler        | character | The bowler who is delivering the ball.                                                         |
    | runs_off_bat  | double    | The number of runs scored off the bat (excluding extras).                                      |
    | extras        | double    | The total number of extra runs (wides, no-balls, byes, leg-byes, penalty) in the current ball. |
    | wides         | double    | The number of wide deliveries bowled in the current ball.                                      |
    | noballs       | double    | The number of no-ball deliveries bowled in the current ball.                                   |
    | byes          | double    | The number of byes scored in the current ball.                                                 |

2.  **ODI_Match_info.csv**: Overlaps in data with the above but provides information on the umpire, performance, and the city the match took place. We'll need this one to analyze the batting and bowling performance of each player. It's dimensions are 2380 rows of data by 18 variable columns.

    Variables that we'll use:

    | Variable Name  | Data type | Description                                                       |

    | team1          | character | The name of the first cricket team participating in the match.    |
    | team2          | character | The name of the second cricket team participating in the match.   |
    | result         | character | The result of the match (e.g., "normal," "tie," "no result").     |
    | winner         | character | The winning team of the match.                                    |
    | win_by_runs    | double    | The margin of victory in runs (0 for wickets, if not applicable). |
    | win_by_wickets | double    | The margin of victory in wickets (0 for runs, if not applicable). |

### Research goals :

1.  Match Outcome Prediction:

    Use historical match data and machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of ongoing matches based on current match conditions (e.g., runs scored, wickets fallen, overs bowled).

    Display the predicted winner and the probability of each team winning the match.

2.  Player Performance Prediction:

    Predict the performance of individual players during the match, including runs scored, wickets taken, and player of the match contenders.

    Utilize player statistics, recent form, and match conditions to generate these predictions.

## Plan of Attack

We will hope to dynamically predict the player stats in the last third of each inning using regression models. We will compare and contrast each model (KNN, Random Forest Regressor etc.) to determine the best performing model. This initial testing will be done with past year's data to validate the models. We hope to then apply the best model to determine how a player will perform based on their last match. We will then use a classification model to predict the winner of each match based on player performance.
