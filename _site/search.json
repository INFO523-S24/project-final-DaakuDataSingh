We plan to use “live” data from 2023 to predict the outcome of the match based on a logistic regression model that takes into account features that are dynamically changing. With each match “update” we will feed the new data into our model to update the prediction it is making. By doing so we can dynamically see how the outcome of a game changes as the match progresses."

    "text": "Goal Details\n\nMotivation:\nFor this project we wanted to showcase our prediction skill-set with the challenge of a live dataset, and what better live dataset to use than sports, so we went with our favorite sport - cricket. Our idea is to compare and contrast a predicted trend with the actual live trend. For the purposes of demonstration we won’t use an actual real-time data as we found that there would be unwanted associated costs, so we will instead use a ready made latest dataset, where our back-end server will automatically update the data table and communicate it to the front-end at regular intervals, essentially mocking a live match.\n\n\nDescription of datasets:\nWe’ll use two datasets:\n\nODI_Match_Data.csv: Provides facts about the location and season of the cricket matches along with team information and the play results from each team member. We’ll need this one to investigate partnerships between batsmen. It’s dimensions are 155432 rows of data by 23 variable columns. The data that appears in this proposal is a truncated version for ease of storage, but the project will utilize an API that will supply the entire dataset.\nVariables that we’ll use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nData type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmatch_id\ndouble\nA unique identifier for each ODI cricket match.\n\n\nseason\ncharacter\nThe season in which the match took place\n\n\nstart_date\ncharacter\nThe date on which the match started.\n\n\ninnings\ndouble\nThe innings number (1st innings or 2nd innings).\n\n\nball\ndouble\nA numeric representation of the ball number bowled in the innings.\n\n\nbatting_team\ncharacter\nThe name of the batting team for the current innings.\n\n\nbowling_team\ncharacter\nThe name of the bowling team for the current innings.\n\n\nstriker\ncharacter\nThe batsman who is currently facing the ball.\n\n\nnon_striker\ncharacter\nThe batsman at the non-striker’s end.\n\n\nbowler\ncharacter\nThe bowler who is delivering the ball.\n\n\nruns_off_bat\ndouble\nThe number of runs scored off the bat (excluding extras).\n\n\nextras\ndouble\nThe total number of extra runs (wides, no-balls, byes, leg-byes, penalty) in the current ball.\n\n\nwides\ndouble\nThe number of wide deliveries bowled in the current ball.\n\n\nnoballs\ndouble\nThe number of no-ball deliveries bowled in the current ball.\n\n\nbyes\ndouble\nThe number of byes scored in the current ball.\n\n\nlegbyes\ndouble\nThe number of leg-byes scored in the current ball.\n\n\n\nODI_Match_info.csv: Overlaps in data with the above but provides information on the umpire, performance, and the city the match took place. We’ll need this one to analyze the batting and bowling performance of each player. It’s dimensions are 2380 rows of data by 18 variable columns.\nVariables that we’ll use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nData type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nid\ndouble\nA unique identifier for each cricket match.\n\n\nseason\ncharacter\nThe season in which the match took place\n\n\ndate\ndate\nThe date on which the match was played.\n\n\nteam1\ncharacter\nThe name of the first cricket team participating in the match.\n\n\nteam2\ncharacter\nThe name of the second cricket team participating in the match.\n\n\nresult\ncharacter\nThe result of the match (e.g., “normal,” “tie,” “no result”).\n\n\nwinner\ncharacter\nThe winning team of the match.\n\n\nwin_by_runs\ndouble\nThe margin of victory in runs (0 for wickets, if not applicable).\n\n\nwin_by_wickets\ndouble\nThe margin of victory in wickets (0 for runs, if not applicable).\n\n\n\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndata = pd.read_csv('data/ODI_Match_Data.csv')\nprint(data.head())\n\n   match_id   season  start_date                           venue  innings  \\\n0   1389389  2023/24  2023-09-24  Holkar Cricket Stadium, Indore        1   \n1   1389389  2023/24  2023-09-24  Holkar Cricket Stadium, Indore        1   \n2   1389389  2023/24  2023-09-24  Holkar Cricket Stadium, Indore        1   \n3   1389389  2023/24  2023-09-24  Holkar Cricket Stadium, Indore        1   \n4   1389389  2023/24  2023-09-24  Holkar Cricket Stadium, Indore        1   \n\n   ball batting_team bowling_team     striker   non_striker  ... wides  \\\n0   0.1        India    Australia  RD Gaikwad  Shubman Gill  ...

Using feature engineering, we will extract pertinent aspects like the location, the bowling and batting teams, the number of runs scored, the number of wickets taken, etc. After dividing the dataset into training and testing sets, the selected model will be trained using the training set. Metrics uch as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score will be used to measure the model’s predictive power on the testing data after training. In the end, we will use the trained model to forecast the match result based on the attributes that were taken out of the data. This strategy will shed light on the likely outcome of the match. This model will be displayed on a dashboard which will refresh every time a new stat is updated, and the prediction from the model will update."
