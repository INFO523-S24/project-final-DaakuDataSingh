## Introduction

The ODI dataset was chosen because it contains data from the last 20 years on historical cricket matches. From this data, we can use a regression model to predict which teams won in the 2023 season. The entire season will be predicted and the the actual 2023 data will be used to cross validate the results and determine the accuracy of the model.
## Why the ODI dataset

```{python}
#| label: load-pkgs
#| message: false
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
#import git_lfs
from git import Repo
```

## Dataset

```{python}
odi_match_data = pd.read_csv('data/ODI_Match_Data.csv')
odi_match_info = pd.read_csv('data/ODI_Match_info.csv')
```


```{python}
# Merge the datasets based on the match id
#merged_data = pd.merge(odi_match_data, odi_match_info, on='match id')

# Print the head of the merged dataset
#print(merged_data.head())
```


## Goal

Predicting 2023 ODI match stats using historical data.
