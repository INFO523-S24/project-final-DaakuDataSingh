## Introduction

The ODI dataset was chosen because it contains data from the last 20 years on historical cricket matches. From this data, we can use a regression model to predict which teams won in the 2023 season. The entire season will be predicted and the the actual 2023 data will be used to cross validate the results and determine the accuracy of the model.
## Why the ODI dataset

```{python}
#| label: load-pkgs
#| message: false
import numpy as np 
import pandas as pd
import git_lfs
```

## Dataset

```{python}
#cat foo.pointer | git lfs smudge
pd.read_csv('data/ODI_Match_Data.csv')
```



## Goal

Predicting 2023 ODI match stats using historical data.
