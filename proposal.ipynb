        "The ODI dataset was chosen because it contains data from the last 20 years on historical cricket matches. From this data, we can use a regression model to predict which teams won in the 2023 season. The entire season will be predicted and the the actual 2023 data will be used to cross validate the results and determine the accuracy of the model. \\## Why the ODI dataset\n"

        "\n",
        "For this project we wanted to showcase our prediction skill-set with the challenge of a live dataset, and what better live dataset to use than sports, so we went with our favorite sport - cricket. Our idea is to compare and contrast a predicted trend with the actual live trend. For the purposes of demonstration we won't use an actual real-time data as we found that there would be unwanted associated costs, so we will instead use a ready made latest dataset, where our back-end server will automatically update the data table and communicate it to the front-end at regular intervals, essentially mocking a live match.\n",

We will compare and contrast each model (KNN, Random Forest Regressor etc.) to determine the best performing model. This initial testing will be done with past year's data to validate the models. We hope to then apply the best model to determine how a player will perform based on their last match. We will then use a classification model to predict the winner of each match based on player performance.\n",
