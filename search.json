    "text": "Goal Details\n\nMotivation:\nFor this project we wanted to showcase our prediction skill-set with the challenge of a live dataset, and what better live dataset to use than sports, so we went with our favorite sport - cricket. Our idea is to compare and contrast a predicted trend with the actual live trend. For the purposes of demonstration we won’t use an actual real-time data as we found that there would be unwanted associated costs, so we will instead use a ready made latest dataset, where our back-end server will automatically update the data table and communicate it to the front-end at regular intervals, essentially mocking a live match.\n\n\nDescription of datasets:\nWe’ll use two datasets:\n\nODI_Match_Data.csv: Provides facts about the location and season of the cricket matches along with team information and the play results from each team member. We’ll need this one to investigate partnerships between batsmen. It’s dimensions are 155432 rows of data by 23 variable columns\nVariables that we’ll use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nData type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmatch_id\ndouble\nA unique identifier for each ODI cricket match.\n\n\nseason\ncharacter\nThe season in which the match took place\n\n\nstart_date\ncharacter\nThe date on which the match started.\n\n\ninnings\ndouble\nThe innings number (1st innings or 2nd innings).\n\n\nball\ndouble\nA numeric representation of the ball number bowled in the innings.\n\n\nbatting_team\ncharacter\nThe name of the batting team for the current innings.\n\n\nbowling_team\ncharacter\nThe name of the bowling team for the current innings.\n\n\nstriker\ncharacter\nThe batsman who is currently facing the ball.\n\n\nnon_striker\ncharacter\nThe batsman at the non-striker’s end.\n\n\nbowler\ncharacter\nThe bowler who is delivering the ball.\n\n\nruns_off_bat\ndouble\nThe number of runs scored off the bat (excluding extras).\n\n\nextras\ndouble\nThe total number of extra runs (wides, no-balls, byes, leg-byes, penalty) in the current ball.\n\n\nwides\ndouble\nThe number of wide deliveries bowled in the current ball.\n\n\nnoballs\ndouble\nThe number of no-ball deliveries bowled in the current ball.\n\n\nbyes\ndouble\nThe number of byes scored in the current ball.\n\n\nlegbyes\ndouble\nThe number of leg-byes scored in the current ball.\n\n\n\nODI_Match_info.csv: Overlaps in data with the above but provides information on the umpire, performance, and the city the match took place. We’ll need this one to analyze the batting and bowling performance of each player. It’s dimensions are 2380 rows of data by 18 variable columns.\nVariables that we’ll use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nData type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nid\ndouble\nA unique identifier for each cricket match.\n\n\nseason\ncharacter\nThe season in which the match took place\n\n\ndate\ndate\nThe date on which the match was played.\n\n\nteam1\ncharacter\nThe name of the first cricket team participating in the match.\n\n\nteam2\ncharacter\nThe name of the second cricket team participating in the match.\n\n\nresult\ncharacter\nThe result of the match (e.g., “normal,” “tie,” “no result”).\n\n\nwinner\ncharacter\nThe winning team of the match.\n\n\nwin_by_runs\ndouble\nThe margin of victory in runs (0 for wickets, if not applicable).\n\n\nwin_by_wickets\ndouble\nThe margin of victory in wickets (0 for runs, if not applicable).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch goals :\n\nMatch Outcome Prediction:\nUse historical match data and machine learning algorithms to predict the outcome of ongoing matches based on current match conditions (e.g., runs scored, wickets fallen, overs bowled).\nDisplay the predicted winner and the probability of each team winning the match.\nPlayer Performance Prediction:\nPredict the performance of individual players during the match, including runs scored, wickets taken, and player of the match contenders.\nUtilize player statistics, recent form, and match conditions to generate these predictions."

We will compare and contrast each model (KNN, Random Forest Regressor etc.) to determine the best performing model. This initial testing will be done with past year’s data to validate the models. We hope to then apply the best model to determine how a player will perform based on their last match. We will then use a classification model to predict the winner of each match based on player performance.\n!Work Plan"
