## Introduction

Since its inception in the late 16th century, cricket has established itself as once of the most popular sports on the planet with yearly viewers numbering in the billions. With so many viewers, prediction of match outcomes have become a hot topic for enthusiasts and sports bettors alike. We plan to use “live” data from 2023 to predict the outcome of the match based on a logistic regression model that takes into account features that are dynamically changing. With each match “update” we will feed the new data into our model to update the prediction it is making. By doing so we can dynamically see how the outcome of a game changes as the match progresses.

## Layouts

You can use plain text

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   or bullet points[^1]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
or in two columns
:::
:::

[^1]: And add footnotes

## Code

```{python}
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

# Fit a linear regression model
X = mtcars[['speed']]
y = mtcars['mpg']
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)

# Summary of the model
X2 = sm.add_constant(X)
est = sm.OLS(y, X2)
est2 = est.fit()
print(est2.summary())
```

## Plots

```{python}
penguins['species'] = penguins['species'].apply(lambda x: "Adelie" if x == "Adelie" else "Other")
sns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x='flipper_length_mm', y='body_mass_g', hue='species')
plt.show()
```

## Plot and text

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some text

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{python}
#| warning: false
#| fig.width: 5.5
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5.5, 5.5 * 0.618))
sns.boxplot(data=penguins, x='bill_length_mm', y='species', hue='species', ax=ax)
plt.show()
```

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{python}
penguins.head().to_html()
```

## Images

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
