        "## Abstract\n",
        "Our project predicts the match results by using historical ODI cricket data and state-of-the-art machine learning. It redefines cricket analysis by closely monitoring forecast accuracy and encouraging user engagement. The primary goal of our project is to use historical and current match data, train them under regression classification models, select the best model and then use it to predict the winner of a cricket match based on the live match statistics (e.g., runs scored, wickets fallen, overs bowled), that update at regular intervals. This model will be displayed on a webpage which will refresh every time a new stat is updated, and the prediction from the model will update.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "For this project we wanted to showcase our prediction skill-set with the challenge of a live dataset, and what better live dataset to use than sports, so we went with our favorite sport - cricket. The past data will include information of ODI Matches from years 2002 to 2022, while the live data will consist of data from the year 2023. Each entry from 2023 will be read from the actual CSV file and entered into a database table with an interval of 10 to 20 seconds between two consecutive entries. These entries will be considered as live data and will be sent to the API caller.\n",
        "\n",
        "We’ll use two datasets:\n",
        "\n",
        "ODI_Match_Data.csv: Provides facts about the location and season of the cricket matches along with team information and the play results from each team member. We’ll need this one to investigate partnerships between batsmen. It’s dimensions are 155432 rows of data by 23 variable columns. The data that appears in this proposal is a truncated version for ease of storage, but the project will utilize an API that will supply the entire dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "ODI_Match_info.csv: Overlaps in data with the above but provides information on the umpire, performance, and the city the match took place. We’ll need this one to analyze the batting and bowling performance of each player. It’s dimensions are 2380 rows of data by 18 variable columns.\n",
